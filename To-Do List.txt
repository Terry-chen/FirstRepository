To-Do list

***Client***
-add a check box that allows you to turn off colored names
-Set up the structure for the Chat Messages tab
-add /r functionality
-keep always on top checkbox


***Server***
-create a password token function (done)
	-the channel admin (the first person in that channel) can use this to request a randomly generated, one time use string token that a player can use to join a channel without the password
-the server should lookup the information of the person sending the message and set the persons font format for their name
	-a possible Easter Egg could be random name color change at random times or when a person types a specific character sequence at the start
-implement ignore functionality


message username security explained:

int nextRand = rand.nextInt(rand.nextInt(5)+rand.nextInt(5)+rand.nextInt(5)+rand.nextInt(5)+rand.nextInt(5)+1); //get a new random number between 0 and 20
for (int i = 0; i<=nextRand; i++)

This could be broken by an altered message class that is designed to return the correct username X amount of times and then return the altered username after that.
The most likely number for X to be would be 0, which would cause the username to be checked only once. However, there is only about a 10% chance that it will be 0 and 
if they're wrong then their IP will be muted and they won't get to try again. If they design the class to return the correct username 20 times before returning the 
spoofed username then it will eventually work and the test will not pick up on failed attempts to spoof the name. However, since 20 only comes up about 0.0015% of the time 
it would probably take about 83333 attempts before they got it.
