HackWars Chat 2.0

This program is designed to be an add-in to the HackWars MMORPG game 
client, though it could easily be converted to a stand alone application.

Users will have the ability to join/leave/create channels, post messaging 
in the channels they have joined, and send private message to other users.
Users can also be made into Admins and Moderators in order to gain functions 
such as muting and kicking players from public channels.

Available Chat Commands
    * /w <name> <text> : Whispers the text to a user.
    * /r <text> : Whispers the text to the last user who whispered you.
    * /sc <name> <password or Token> : Creates a channel with the given password. 
			If no password is provided it is open for all. If the channel already 
			exists then the channel will be joined, provided the supplied password 
			is correct.
    * /getToken : Channel Admin only. Will return a random 15 character string 
			that can be used once to join that channel without the channels 
			password. Only one token may exist at a time for any single channel.
    * /lc : Leaves the current channel.
    * /kick <username> : kick a user out of the channel. You need to be the 
			channel Admin or a Moderator to do this.
    * /stfu <username> : Mods only. mutes a user. To unmute use the same command.
    * /getIP <username> : Mods only. Allows the moderator to check the IP of a 
			connected client in order to help prevent chat spam with multiple accounts.
    * /muteIP <IP Address> : Mods and !System! only. Mutes all incoming messages 
			from the supplied IP until the chat server is restarted.
    * /me <action> : Does an action in that channel
    * /startUserList : Mods and Channel Admins only. Will start the user list on
			that channel for all connected clients. Once the user list is turned 
			on it can not be turned off.
    * /afk : will toggle the users current status to AFK mode. This will be displayed next to the user's name in all channel user lists. 


The program is broken into three main parts (server, client, and messages).
The server communicates with the clients by sending message classes 
through its socket connection.
